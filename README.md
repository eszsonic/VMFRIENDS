# VMFRIENDS
This repository shares open hardware and software for a Vaping Machine for FRIENDS (VMFRIENDS)

The hardware and software described here are shared by the Computer Laboratory of Ambient and Wearable Systems [CLAWS](https://claws.eng.ua.edu/298-flexible-robust-instrumentation-of-electronic-nicotine-delivery-systems-friends) at the University of Alabama.

The Flexible Robust Instrumentation of ENDS (FRIENDS) electronic device employs a miniature non-contact electromagnetic sensor that detects the current flow from the battery through the heater coil, allowing detection of puffs and puff duration regardless of ENDS generation and/or physical form (e.g., cig-alikes, pens, tanks, and pods systems).

Various components of the FRIENDS ecosystem are shared as separate repositories. The full list may be found at the [CLAWS FRIENDS repository list](https://claws.eng.ua.edu/research-projects/44-friends/301-open-source-friends-repository)
